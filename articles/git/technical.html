<hr />

<p>Welcome to this (relatively) short explanation of the technical "behind-the-scenes" side of Git. Git is a Source
Code Management (SCM) tool that is open source and a lot more scalable and than other alternatives, although it has a
somewhat hard-to-understand interface. It was originally developed as a tool for the Linux kernel because managing that
code ran out of hand, but then it turned out many people needed better source control, so now it is the most widely
used SCM in the world.</p>

<p>Besides Git, there are tools like Github, Gitlab and Bitbucket, which are (online) interfaces for hosting Git
repositories. In addition to hosting them, they often have many extra features like issues/bug lists, pull requests
(PRs, also called merge requests), reviewing, task management boards and sometimes entire social media platforms. Note
that (confusingly) some features that you use a lot (like PRs) are Github features and not Git features. With that out
of the way, I'm going to get started on how Git works!</p>

<p>I will have some "<strong>Try yourself</strong>" sections for where you can try examples on your own Git repo and
"<strong>Git command</strong>" sections for explaining what a high-level command does (e.g. <code>git commit</code> or
<code>git reset</code>).</p>

<h2 id="blobs-trees-hashes"><a href="#blobs-trees-hashes">Blobs, Trees and Hashes</a></h2>

<p>Before thinking about commits and different versions of the code, just imagine there is only one version of your
code (the one you have in the directory of your project). If you have one file with source code, then Git will store
this source code in a "blob" (not the file, only the <em>contents</em> of the file). It will store a blob in the
directory <code>.git/objects</code>; to identify a blob, it will compute a SHA-1 hash (which is not actually guaranteed
to be unique, but the chance is quite high) such as <code>7fd015...</code> etc. Usually it only displays the first 6
digits.</p>

<p>Of course your repo does not consist of one file with source code, so there are also "trees". A tree is kind of like
a directory, where each entry has a name such as <code>src</code> or <code>main.ts</code>, which in turn refers to
another object (a tree or blob). For a tree, Git also calculates a unique(-ish) hash.</p>

<p>Even if you have 10000 different commits of a file that are all only 1 character different, it will store each
version of this file's content in a separate blob object, meaning you have 10000 copies that are almost identical,
since each version will have a completely different hash. Fortunately, Git will do some magic compression to not take
up 10000 times as much disk space, but <em>conceptually</em> you should think of them as different copies.</p>

<p><strong>Try yourself:</strong> go to any git repository and then use the following command in a terminal:</p>

<p><pre><code>$ tree /F .git/objects
<span class="hljs-comment"># if Bash: ls -R .git/objects</span>
</code></pre></p>

<p>You might see something like this:</p>

<p><pre><code>├───00
│       b7741d13a2a8edf0b8aa457be25c1b05bb1de2
│
├───04
│       c5e626e6abe8006e052fa26b645344a89f6c36
│
├───07
│       723145fc8d316195072cd20237428759c2e07e
│       a58ac8d78fd0adcbf6a80f8a23a1156d795f5a
etc.
</code></pre></p>

<p>Now just pick any entry, enter the first 6 digits including the ones in the directory (for instance, 00b774 or
04c5e6) and run these commands:</p>

<p><pre><code>$ git cat-file -t 04c5e6
tree

$ git cat-file -p 04c5e6
100644 blob 3e354001a908625dd3fe5a7cd3fda1b283f2d953    README.md
040000 tree 90c6615d02ebf8c948a5fdd01b6bb3ca012f4f9f    src
(etc.)
</code></pre></p>

<p>Some of them will give you trees, others will give blobs, others will give commits. Doing <code>git cat-file
-p</code> will show you the data that is in a Git object, while using <code>-t</code> shows if it is a blob, tree or
commit.</p>

<h2 id="commits"><a href="#commits">Commits</a></h2>

<p>In my opinion, "commit" is not a very good name; "snapshot" probably describes better how it works. Each commit is a
complete snapshot of everything in your project.</p>

<p>Implementation-wise, a commit is really just the hash of a single tree object, namely the tree object that describes
the corresponding version of your project directory. It also has a bit of extra data, such as the commit message and
author of the commit.</p>

<p>Finally, a commit also has a parent (except if it's the first commit ever, then it has no parent). This is the hash
of the commit object that came before this commit.</p>

<p>In the .git folder you will also find a file called "HEAD". If you open it, it will show you a reference to some
branch or to a commit (if it's a commit, you might see something like "Detached HEAD" in a Git client). HEAD refers to
the commit that you are currently on.</p>

<img src="/images/git/technical/github-desktop-history.png" />

<p><strong>Git command log:</strong> if you use <code>git log --oneline</code> or you view the history of commits in
Github Desktop it essentially does a simple tree walk algorithm:</p>

<p><pre><code>currentCommit = HEAD
print(currentCommit.hash, currentCommit.message)
while (currentCommit.parent exists) {
    currentCommit = currentCommit.parent
    print(currentCommit.hash, currentCommit.message)
}
</code></pre></p>

<h2 id="tags-and-branches"><a href="#tags-and-branches">Tags and Branches</a></h2>

<p>A tag is essentially just a nice name for the hash of an object (usually a commit). A branch is the same thing.
The only difference is that when you use commands like <code>git commit</code> or <code>git reset</code>, git will
automatically update branches for you, while you have to update tags yourself.</p>

<p>Git stores tags in <code>.git/refs/tags</code>, while it stores branches in <code>.git/refs/heads</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Try yourself:</strong> run the following in any git repo:</p>

<p><pre><code><span class="hljs-comment"># Create branch or tag called "example":</span>
$ git branch example       # or git tag example

$ cat .git/heads/example   # or .git/tags/example
<span class="hljs-comment"># This is the hash of a commit:</span>
b4aa4d1fb12f770e90d5fc27fea64e21e364368d

$ git cat-file -p b4aa4d   # first 6 digits
tree 927c472a22118dcb365ace4232c0137d5484e833
parent e2b52132f4f122bf054bddb314b502b04bfc3806
author (SOME INFO)
committer (SOME INFO)

Message of last commit you made
</code></pre></p>

<p>So you can see that a branch/tag is really just an alias for the hash of a commit object.</p>

<p><strong>Git command branch/tag:</strong> when you use <code>git branch branch-name</code>, it essentially does the
following:</p>

<p><pre><code>hash = HEAD.hash
createFile(".git/refs/heads/(branch-name)", content=hash)
HEAD = "refs/heads/(branch-name)"
</code></pre></p>

<p>The <code>git tag tag-name</code> command does the exact same thing, except it does not do the last line. You can use
<code>git branch --list</code> or <code>git tag --list</code> to see the branches/tags you created.</p>

<img src="/images/git/technical/github-desktop-commit.png" />

<p><strong>Git command commit:</strong> when you use <code>git commit</code>, it essentially inserts a node at the end
of the commit tree and sets the parent of this new commit to the last commit:</p>

<p><pre><code>commit = new Commit()
commit.tree = currentTree.hash
commit.parent = HEAD.hash
storeGitObject(commit)
if (HEAD refers to some branch B) {   <span class="hljs-comment"># i.e. not in detached HEAD state</span>   
    make B refer to commit.hash
    make HEAD refer to B
} else {
    make HEAD refer to commit.hash
}
</code></pre></p>

<img src="/images/git/technical/github-desktop-switch-branch.png" />

<p><strong>Git command checkout:</strong> when you use <code>git checkout branch-name</code> or <code>git switch
branch-name</code> or you switch to a different branch in Github Desktop, all it does is <code>HEAD =
"refs/heads/branch-name"</code> (and in case you had some changes, it will move these over to the new branch).</p>

<p>Additionally, you can do <code>git checkout aa1e3a</code> (or with any other hash) to make the HEAD refer to that
commit. Git or a Git client will then tell you that you are in "detached HEAD state", meaning that your HEAD does not
refer to a branch, but to a "loose" commit.</p>

<p><strong>Git command reset:</strong> you can instead use <code>git reset</code> to move back to another commit (I
don't think there is an equivalent for this in Github Desktop). Instead of moving HEAD to another commit, this moves
the <em>branch</em> that you are on to another commit (assuming your HEAD is not detached). For instance, you can use
<code>git reset --hard HEAD~2</code> to move the branch you are on back to the grandparent (~2) of the HEAD. (Using
--soft instead of --hard will keep the changes of the commits that you passed in your project folder, while --hard
deletes them entirely).</p>

<h2 id="rewriting-history"><a href="#rewriting-history">Rewriting Histry</a></h2>

<p>Now finally, there are some cool things that you can do with Git which will surely be useful at some point. Note
that when you rewrite history, there will be a strong difference between what you have in your local clone of the repo
and the remote repository (assuming you are working with a remote). This means that if other people are working on the
same branch as you, it will mess up their history. Therefore I <em>strongly</em> suggest you never force-push to the
main branch unless you are working on your own.</p>

<img src="/images/git/technical/github-desktop-amend-commit.png" />

<p><strong>Git command commit --amend:</strong> you can use <code>git commit --amend</code> to not create a new commit, but to modify
the current (HEAD) commit instead. When you have added your changes with <code>git add</code> or a client like Github
Desktop, you can use this flag to rewrite history. It essentially does the following:</p>

<p><pre><code>commit = new Commit()
commit.tree = currentTree.hash
commit.parent = HEAD.parent.hash      <span class="hljs-comment"># NOTE only difference: HEAD.parent</span> 
storeGitObject(commit)
if (HEAD refers to some branch B) {   <span class="hljs-comment"># i.e. not in detached HEAD state</span>   
    make B refer to commit.hash
    make HEAD refer to B
} else {
    make HEAD refer to commit.hash
}
</code></pre></p>

<img src="/images/git/technical/github-desktop-rebase.png" />

<p><strong>Git command rebase:</strong> imagine you are working on two different branches, <code>main</code> and
<code>feature1</code>. The Git tree might look likes this, where each node is a commit:</p>

<img src="/images/git/technical/rebase-before.png" />

<p>Assuming your HEAD refers to feature1, if you use <code>git rebase main</code> (or use Github Desktop for this), the
graph will change as follows:</p>

<img src="/images/git/technical/rebase-step1.png" />

<img src="/images/git/technical/rebase-step2.png" />

<p>Now that you have rebased <code>feature1</code> onto <code>main</code>, it is really easy to make a pull request for
the <code>feature1</code>branch; after all, git can simply do the following:</p>

<p><pre><code>make main refer to feature1.hash
</code></pre></p>

<p><strong>Git command rebase -i:</strong> TODO</p>
